Gentoo is the coolest. We should support that. It does require a bit of a rework, but I made it happen. Config, binaries, and data are stored in different places. The configs are actually different too so there's a translation library in place to rename all the keys. It's pretty cool. About 700 lines, but works great. YOLO!
